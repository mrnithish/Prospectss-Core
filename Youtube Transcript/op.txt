This is a national
emergency.
Detonator's charged.
We're in a race
against the Nazis,
and I know what it means
if the Nazis have a bomb.
They have a 12 month head start.
-18.
How could you
possibly know that?
We've got one hope.
All America's
industrial might
and scientific innovation
connected here,
a secret laboratory.
Keep everyone
there until it's done.
Let's go recruit
some scientists.
Build a town,
build it fast.
If we don't let scientists
bring their families
we'll never get the best.
Why would we go to
the middle of nowhere
for who knows how long?
Why? Why?
How about because this is
the most important thing
to ever happen in the
history of the world.
You're the great
improviser but this...
You can't do in your head.
Are we saying
there's a chance
that when we
push that button,
we destroy the world?
Chances are near zero.
Near zero?
What do you want
from theory alone?
Zero would be nice.
This is a matter
of life and death.
I can perform this miracle.
World War II
would be over.
Our boys would
come home.
It's happening, isn't it?
The world will
remember this day.
Our work here
will ensure
a peace mankind
has never seen.
Until somebody
builds a bigger bomb.
You are the man who
gave them the power
to destroy themselves,
and the world
is not prepared.
Eight...
Seven...
Six...
Five...
Four...
Three...
Truman needs to
know what's next.
Two...
What's next?
-One.
